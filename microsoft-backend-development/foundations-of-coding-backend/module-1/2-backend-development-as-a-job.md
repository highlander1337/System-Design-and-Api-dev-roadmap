## üîÑ Typical Workflow in Back-End Development

Back-end development follows a structured, iterative workflow that includes:

1. **Planning & Architecture Design**
   - Define requirements and design system architecture.
   - Tools: **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, **Azure Architecture Center**

2. **Development & Integration**
   - Write business logic, implement APIs, manage data models.

3. **Testing & Code Review**
   - Unit Testing: `xUnit`, `Pytest`, `Jest`
   - Code Reviews: Pull requests using GitHub or Azure Repos
   - Static Code Analysis: **SonarQube**, **ESLint**, **Roslyn Analyzers**

4. **Deployment & CI/CD**
   - Automate builds, tests, and deployments using:
     - **GitHub Actions**
     - **Azure Pipelines**
     - **Docker + Kubernetes (AKS)**
     - **Terraform / Bicep** (Infrastructure as Code)

5. **Monitoring & Iteration**
   - Use Application Insights, Azure Monitor, or Datadog to track performance and resolve issues.
   - Iterate based on feedback, logs, and metrics.
