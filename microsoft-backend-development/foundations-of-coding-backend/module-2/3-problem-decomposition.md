# Problem Decomposition in Backend Development

## Introduction

Problem decomposition is a strategy used in software development and other fields to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. This method makes understanding, managing, and solving complex challenges easier.

For example, when developers face a critical issue spread throughout an application, decomposing the problem into specific components, like **user authentication** or **payment processing**, allows for more focused troubleshooting and efficient problem-solving.

In backend engineering, problem decomposition is especially useful when building scalable systems, designing APIs, or isolating responsibilities across services.

## Benefits of Decomposing Complex Problems

Decomposing problems offers several advantages:

1. **Simplified Debugging** – Isolating smaller parts of the problem makes it easier to identify and fix issues.
2. **Improved Implementation** – Developers can build and test individual components separately, reducing errors and enhancing team collaboration.
3. **Better Maintenance** – Updates or changes can be made to specific parts without disrupting the entire system, reducing downtime and improving overall system stability.
4. **Scalability** – Decomposition aligns well with backend practices like microservices, modular monoliths, and domain-driven design.

## Techniques for Decomposing Problems

### Top-down Approach

This technique starts with a broad overview of the problem and gradually breaks it into more detailed components.

* Example: Building an **e-commerce site**

  * High-level goal: "Create an online store."
  * Breakdown:

    * Design the homepage
    * Develop product pages
    * Implement authentication
    * Build the checkout process
    * Integrate payment services

### Modularization

Modularization divides a problem into self-contained units or modules, each performing a specific function.

* Example: Separating **authentication logic** into its own module makes it reusable and easier to maintain across multiple services.
* Backend perspective: Modules can map directly to **services, bounded contexts (DDD), or code packages** with clear interfaces.

## Backend Engineering Best Practices for Problem Decomposition

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Split the system into bounded contexts (e.g., *Orders*, *Payments*, *Authentication*).
* **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Keep business logic, persistence, and presentation layers independent.
* **Layered Architecture:** Decompose into layers (Presentation → Service → Repository/Data Access).
* **Testing Strategy:** Apply unit tests for modules, integration tests for interconnections, and contract tests for APIs.
* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Run builds and tests independently per service or module.
* **Observability:** Use logging, monitoring, and tracing scoped to each component (e.g., *Prometheus*, *Grafana*, *OpenTelemetry*).

## Tools that Support Decomposition

* **Diagramming:** Lucidchart, PlantUML, Draw\.io
* **Project Management:** Jira, Linear, GitHub Projects
* **API Design & Documentation:** Postman, Swagger/OpenAPI
* **Version Control & Collaboration:** GitHub, GitLab

## Technologies for Modular Backend Systems

* **Frameworks:** FastAPI (Python), Spring Boot (Java), NestJS (Node.js)
* **Service Communication:** REST with OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC
* **Data Management:** CQRS, Event Sourcing for separating concerns in persistence
* **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose (local modular testing), Kubernetes (namespaces, Helm charts for deployments)

## Conclusion

Complex problems become easier to handle by using problem decomposition techniques such as the **top-down approach** and **modularization**. These methods provide structure, reduce errors, improve collaboration, and enhance the efficiency of managing and maintaining complex systems.

When combined with backend engineering practices such as **domain-driven design, modular architectures, and CI/CD pipelines**, problem decomposition becomes a cornerstone for building robust, scalable, and maintainable backend systems.
